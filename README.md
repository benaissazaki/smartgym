# SmartGym
A landing page for a fictional gym.

## Tools used
- HTML
- SASS
- Javascript (Vanilla)

## Project structure
- / : Contains index.html and package.json...
  - assets
    - img: Images
    - stylesheets: 
      - source: Contains SASS source code
      - build: Contains CSS code generated after running `npm run compile` or `npm run watch` (GITIGNORED)

## Project timeline
1. I did a quick research about the relevant colours for gyms, I chose blue because it is "often 
associated with services in the medical industry, like doctors, and can increase the trustworthiness of your website and brand."
2. I chose my fonts, 'Asap' for headings and 'Montserrat' for normal text
3. I created the project with npm to use SASS and npm scripts
4. I defined the global styles with SASS (fonts, colours, section paddings...etc)
5. I implemented what I had in mind

## Why I built it this way
- I didn't use any UI library for higher customizability and better learning
- I used SASS instead of CSS to have a better organized code
- I used Git and Github to track changes
- I converted all images to WebP for size optimization

## Ways to improve
- Make a figma wireframe before the implementation
- Use colours better
- Make the page more dynamic with animations
